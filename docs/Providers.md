# Providers

The 'app-studio' library uses context providers to share common state or behavior across components. The library provides the responsive context provider, which you can use to set the breakpoints for different screen sizes in your application.

The responsive context provider is used internally by the `useResponsive` hook to get the breakpoints, devices, and media queries values. You can also use the responsive context provider directly in your components to access these values.
